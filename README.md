# Mini C Project â€“ Data Structures & Algorithms

This project is a menu-driven C program that demonstrates fundamental programming concepts:

- **Basic operations**: number base conversions, binary addition, prime factorization, and printing patterns.  
- **Recursion**: string reversal, absolute-difference number generation, subset sum, and recursive sorting.  
- **Data structures**: dynamic user database with linked lists for managing users, TV series, and episodes.  


## ðŸš€ Build & Run  
```bash
gcc main.c -o totalProject
./totalProject
```
You can also compile and run the program using the included makefile.
```bash
make      
make run   
make clean  
```
